# findjobs
 This project was first created for the most important test of my course, with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for responsivity), JS, PHP and SQL, however, I have decided to make it with ReactJS and Firebase. In findjobs, you can join in a project to develop it or also create a project to people develop your idea.
